28-02-24

# What is it:
- In a federated learning sysem, multiple parties collaboratively train ML models without exchanging their raw data; 
- The output is an ML model for each party (which can be same or different)

# Components:

## Parties
These are the owners and the beneficiaries of federated learning systems e.g organizations or mobile phones


## Managers:
In the cross-device setting, the manager is usually a powerful central server. It conducts the training of the global machine learning model and manages the communication between the parties and the server.



In the cross-silo setting, since the organizations are expected to have powerful machines, the manager can also be one of the organizations who dominates the FL process.
